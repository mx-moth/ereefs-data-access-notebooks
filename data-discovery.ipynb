    "The other notebooks in this repository use data service URLs (mostly [OPeNDAP](https://www.opendap.org/) endpoints) to query the eReefs datasets from the locations they have been published to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major benefit to this approach is that you don't have to download the data to work with it, or know how to join data from all the files in the data, you can just *query* the complete collection of files from a single URL!\n",
    "\n",
    "The trick, though, is knowing *which* URL to use!\n",

    "This notebook does not contain executable code, but is a description of the steps you can follow to find the data service URLs for any eReefs dataset.\n",
